>- A [field-programmable gate array (FPGA)](https://earthpeopletechnology.com/products-page-2/modules/dueprologic) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence the term field-programmable. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, but this is increasingly rare due to the advent of electronic design automation tools.

For now, I'll try to emulate multiple `ingress IP by cloudflared` on my desktop, and submit my `beta access firebase tokenId users` to my waking hours and potential downtime.
